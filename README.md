Hi there, Nice to see you! 👋


Welcome to my page

My name is Enohense Sandra Idemudia, I'm a backend developer passionate about building reliable and scalable systems. With hands-on experience in C#, .NET, SQL (PostgreSQL & SQL Server), and financial reporting systems, I thrive in fast-paced fintech environments where precision and performance matter.

🌱 Currently learning: Docker, Unit Testing, and Software Architecture

🔭 Working on: Monthly account statement automation, system optimization, and report reconciliation

🌍 Languages: C#, SQL, a bit of Python, and English (native speaker)

📫 How to reach me: williamssandra803@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I transitioned from a finance background into tech, and I still love numbers as much as clean code!

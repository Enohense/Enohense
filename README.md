Hi there, Nice to see you! ðŸ‘‹


Welcome to my page

My name is Enohense Sandra Idemudia, I'm a backend developer passionate about building reliable and scalable systems. With hands-on experience in C#, .NET, SQL (PostgreSQL & SQL Server), and financial reporting systems, I thrive in fast-paced fintech environments where precision and performance matter.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Docker, Unit Testing, and Software Architecture

ðŸ”­ Working on: Monthly account statement automation, system optimization, and report reconciliation

âš¡ Fun fact: I transitioned from a finance background into tech, and I still love numbers as much as clean code!
